# MEXPerformance_MVE
MVE of my terrible code.

TransPoreEEMSolverMAINSCRIPT is the main script where everyhting is called, I've put the relevant stuff in the first code section. The different meshes can be loaded in on line 12. The function that builds the mex file is found in BuildFVMElementLoop (my apologies for the LARGE number of inputs). The main function whithin this script is TransPoreFluxRd3. The MEX file in question is th FVMTPETransPoreElementLoop.


A code structure diagram is added as EEM2.pdf
